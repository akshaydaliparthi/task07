🍞 Bakery Sales Analysis
This project demonstrates how to use SQLite, Pandas, and Matplotlib to manage, analyze, and visualize sales data from a bakery.

📊 Project Overview
A SQLite database is used to store sales data for various bakery items.

Data is analyzed using SQL queries and visualized using Python's data analysis libraries.

The final output is a bar chart that shows the total revenue generated by each item.

📁 Files
bakery_sales.db - SQLite database containing the sales data.

bakery_sales_chart.png - Bar chart showing total revenue by bakery item.

main.py (or whatever your script is named) - Python script to create the database, insert data, run analysis, and generate a chart.

🛠️ Technologies Used
SQLite3 - Lightweight database engine.

Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib - Data visualization.

📌 How It Works
A SQLite database and bakery_sales table are created.

Sample sales data is inserted for various items (Bread, Muffin, Croissant, Cake Slice).

SQL is used to calculate:

Total quantity sold per item.

Total revenue per item.

Results are loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and displayed.

A bar chart is created to visualize total revenue by item.

         item  total_sold  total_revenue
0       Bread          32           80.0
1  Cake Slice          14           56.0
2   Croissant          25           75.0
3      Muffin          38           76.0


▶️ How to Run
Ensure Python is installed with the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
The chart will be displayed and saved as bakery_sales_chart.png.
